##The goal of this task is to create a real-time chat application that allows users to send and receive messages instantly. The main feature is that messages appear for all users as soon as they are sent, without needing to refresh the page. This is achieved by using WebSocket technology, specifically with the help of the Socket.IO library, which makes real-time communication between the frontend and backend much easier.

For development, I used a combination of standard web technologies and Node.js. The frontend of the application is built with HTML for the structure, CSS for styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript to handle user interactions and connect to the backend. The backend is set up using Node.js, with the Socket.IO library managing the real-time connections between users.

The development process included the following steps:
- Setting up the backend server with Node.js and integrating Socket.IO to handle real-time messaging.
- Creating the frontend layout with HTML, including a message display area and an input box for sending new messages.
- Using CSS to make sure the chat interface is clean and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Writing JavaScript on the frontend to connect to the backend using Socket.IO, send messages, and update the chat window whenever a new message is received.

The application can be run locally on a computer, and users can access it through any modern web browser. Both the frontend and backend need to be running for the chat to work, and they communicate in real time using WebSocket connections managed by Socket.IO.

If thereâ€™s a need to add more features in the future, such as user authentication or message history, the current structure makes it easy to expand. The main focus for now was to keep the app simple and functional, demonstrating how real-time communication can be achieved with basic tools and clear integration between the frontend and backend.
